# Description
This is a simple pascal compiler + interpreter.  
The grammar is located in gram.txt (reduced grammar from http://www.felix-colibri.com/papers/compilers/pascal_grammar/pascal_grammar.html).  
### Compilation
The compiler (pascalc) runs 4 tasks :  
&nbsp; **Lexical analysis :** dividing the input into lexemes/words.   
&nbsp; **Synataxial analysis :** grouping lexemes and matching them against synataxial/production rules to form sentences.    
&nbsp; **Semantic analysis :** checking whether these sentences are valid (meaningful).  
&nbsp; **Code generation :** generates bytecode (custom opcodes) equivalent to the instructions of the pascal source code provided.    
### Interpretation
The interpreter (pascal) is responsible for running the bytecode (*.bin file) generated by the compiler.  
# Execution
First of all,a c++ compiler supporting c++20 should be installed.  
Compile the pascalc and pascal as follows (clang++ for example) :  
&nbsp; `clang++ -std=c++20 lexer.cxx parser.cxx vm.cxx pascalc.cxx -o pascalc`  
&nbsp; `clang++ -std=c++20 vm.cxx pascal.cxx -o pascal`  
To compile and run an pascal program provide the filename without extension as an argument.  
For instance :  
&nbsp; `pascalc test/say_hello`  
&nbsp; `pascal test/say_hello`
